      <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
      <p>Machine learning is an aspect of artificial intelligence where computer algorithms are trained to perform certain repetitive tasks done by humans.</p>

          <h2>Supervised learning</h2>
          <p>In simple terms, when we are training a machine learning algorithm with a label dataset which enhances the algorithm to learn the patterns between the input and the outcomes, this type of training is called SUPERVISED learning.

          <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
          <p>Unsupervised Learning is the direct opposite of supervised learnining where a machine learning model is train on a given data with no labels. Since it is learning without any labels, the model tries to identify patterns, groupings and the structure of the given data in order to be able to make predictions.</p>

          <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
          <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards</p>
